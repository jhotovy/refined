<p>

You do not have to be good.<br/>
You do not have to walk on your knees<br/>
for a hundred miles through the desert, repenting.<br/>
You only have to let the soft animal of your body<br/>
love what it loves.<br/>
Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.<br/>
Meanwhile the world goes on.<br/>
Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain<br/>
are moving across the landscapes,<br/>
over the prairies and the deep trees,<br/>
the mountains and the rivers.<br/>
Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air,<br/>
are heading home again.<br/>
Whoever you are, no matter how lonely,<br/>
the world offers itself to your imagination,<br/>
calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting â€“<br/>
over and over announcing your place<br/>
in the family of things.<br/>
